## TEMPLATE 1: INITIAL OUTREACH EMAIL (PRIMARY)

**Subject:** Legal Review Request - SaaS Startup (GDPR/AI Compliance)

**To:** [Lawyer's email]

**Body:**

Hi [Lawyer's Name],

My name is Gayan Jayasundara, founder of AuditsReady, a SaaS platform that uses AI to help manufacturers achieve ISO 9001 certification. I'm seeking legal counsel to review our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and customer agreements before we launch.

**About AuditsReady:**
- **Business Model:** AI-powered compliance guidance platform (SaaS subscription)
- **Target Market:** Small-medium manufacturers worldwide (10-500 employees)
- **Stage:** Pre-launch, preparing to onboard first paying customers
- **Team:** 2 people (founder is a licensed P.Eng)
- **Website:** https://auditsready.com

**Why Legal Review is Critical:**
- High-liability industry (customers spend $50k-$150k on ISO certification)
- AI-generated content requires strong disclaimers
- Worldwide service = GDPR compliance for EU customers
- Need protection against professional liability claims

**What I Need:**
1. Review and edit 5 draft legal documents (~27,000 words total):
   - Terms of Service
   - Master Services Agreement (for paying customers)
   - Privacy Policy (GDPR-compliant)
   - Acceptable Use Policy
   - Refund and Cancellation Policy

2. Advise on critical legal questions:
   - Jurisdiction selection (Alberta? Delaware? Other?)
   - Liability caps and disclaimers sufficiency
   - GDPR compliance for EU customers
   - Professional liability (E&O) insurance requirements
   - AI-specific liability risks

3. Help with business formation (LLC or Corporation) if within your scope

**What I've Prepared:**
I've drafted all 5 documents as starting points for your review (not final, just to save time). I've also prepared a comprehensive summary document with:
- Business context and legal concerns
- 15 critical legal questions requiring your input
- Compliance checklists (GDPR, CCPA, FTC)
- Implementation timeline

**What I'm Looking For:**
- Lawyer with SaaS/technology law experience
- GDPR compliance expertise (critical)
- Familiarity with AI liability issues (emerging area)
- Practical, startup-friendly advice
- Transparent pricing and timeline

**Next Steps:**
If this is within your expertise and you're taking new clients, I'd love to schedule a 30-minute consultation call to discuss:
1. Your experience with similar SaaS clients
2. Your approach to GDPR and AI liability
3. Estimated cost and timeline for this engagement

I can provide all draft documents and the summary beforehand so you can assess the scope.

**Budget:** $3,000-$8,000 for document review and advisory (flexible based on your recommendation)

**Timeline:** Ideally start within 1-2 weeks, complete within 3-4 weeks

Are you available for a brief call this week or next? I'm flexible on timing.

Thank you for considering this. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
