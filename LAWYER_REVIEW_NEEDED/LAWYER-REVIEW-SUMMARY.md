## CRITICAL LEGAL QUESTIONS REQUIRING ANSWERS

### JURISDICTION AND DISPUTES
1. **Which jurisdiction should govern the agreements?**
   - Options: Alberta (founder location), Delaware (business-friendly), customer jurisdiction
   - Considerations: Enforceability, legal costs, forum shopping

2. **Arbitration or litigation?**
   - Pros of arbitration: Faster, cheaper, confidential
   - Cons: May be unenforceable in EU, limits customer appeal rights
   - Recommendation needed: Binding arbitration, mediation, or court jurisdiction?

3. **Class action waiver enforceable?**
   - Some jurisdictions prohibit class action waivers
   - GDPR implications for EU users

### LIABILITY PROTECTION
4. **Is our liability cap sufficient?**
   - Current draft: Greater of 12 months fees or $1,000
   - Context: Customers pay $50k-$150k for ISO certification, could sue for full amount
   - Question: What cap provides adequate protection without being unconscionable?

5. **What insurance do we need?**
   - Professional Liability (E&O) insurance: How much? ($1M? $2M?)
   - Cyber Liability insurance required?
   - General Commercial Liability sufficient?

6. **P.Eng disclaimer adequate?**
   - Founder is a licensed Professional Engineer (P.Eng)
   - Draft states: "Services are not professional engineering services"
   - Question: Does this adequately protect against PE liability claims?

### DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY
7. **How do we comply with GDPR for EU customers?**
   - Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) needed with all vendors?
   - Data Protection Officer (DPO) required? (Threshold: "large scale processing")
   - EU representative required?

8. **Do we need a Data Processing Addendum (DPA)?**
   - For B2B customers who input employee data (names, roles, etc.)
   - Must we sign DPAs with every customer?

9. **Cookie consent requirements?**
   - GDPR requires opt-in consent for non-essential cookies
   - Do we need a cookie banner? (Likely yes)
   - What about Google Analytics 4 - still GDPR-compliant?

### CONSUMER PROTECTION
10. **What refund policy minimizes risk and builds trust?**
    - Option A: No money-back guarantee (minimizes abuse)
    - Option B: 14-day guarantee (industry standard, builds trust)
    - Option C: 30-day guarantee (high trust, higher abuse risk)
    - Recommendation?

11. **FTC Negative Option Rule compliance?**
    - Auto-renewals must be clearly disclosed
    - Cancellation must be "as easy as signup"
    - Are our checkout disclosures sufficient?

12. **State-specific laws?**
    - California: Automatic renewal law (BAR Act)
    - New York: Consumer protection laws
    - Do we need state-specific disclosures?

### AI-SPECIFIC RISKS
13. **Are AI disclaimers enforceable?**
    - Draft includes strong AI limitation disclaimers
    - Question: Will courts enforce "AI may be wrong" disclaimers?
    - Precedent for AI liability cases?

14. **AI model transparency requirements?**
    - EU AI Act (coming 2025-2026): Transparency obligations
    - Must we disclose which AI models we use?
    - Must we explain AI decision-making?

15. **What happens if AI gives catastrophically bad advice?**
    - Example: AI tells customer to delete a critical SOP, they fail audit
    - Are our disclaimers sufficient defense?

## RED FLAGS TO DISCUSS WITH LAWYER

### HIGH PRIORITY 🚨
1. **Consequential damages exclusion:** Is it enforceable given the high-stakes nature of ISO certification?
2. **EU-US data transfers:** Post-Schrems II, are Standard Contractual Clauses sufficient?
3. **AI liability:** No clear legal precedent for AI errors causing business harm
4. **Professional engineering credential:** Does P.Eng use increase liability exposure?

### MEDIUM PRIORITY ⚠️
5. **Class action waiver:** May be unenforceable in some jurisdictions
6. **Auto-renewal disclosures:** FTC scrutiny increasing, must be crystal clear
7. **Money-back guarantee abuse:** Need safeguards against serial refunders
8. **Third-party IP infringement:** What if customer uploads stolen SOPs?

### LOWER PRIORITY ℹ️
9. **Cookie consent implementation:** Technical not legal question
10. **DPA template boilerplate:** Can use standard templates
11. **State-specific disclosures:** Likely not needed if federal compliance met
