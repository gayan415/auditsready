## LAWYER REVIEW CHECKLIST

**Critical items requiring attorney input:**

- [ ] Money-back guarantee duration for project-based services (7 or 14 days from deliverable receipt?)
- [ ] EU withdrawal right waiver language for consulting services (GDPR compliant?)
- [ ] Consumer protection laws by jurisdiction (Canada, UK, Australia, etc.)
- [ ] Chargeback policies and enforceability for one-time project fees
- [ ] Pro-rated refund calculations for partially completed projects
- [ ] Data retention after project completion (90 days compliant with privacy laws?)
- [ ] Dispute resolution for refund denials
- [ ] Tax implications of refunds (sales tax, VAT refunds)
- [ ] "Work begins immediately" consent language for EU customers
- [ ] Cancellation timing (before vs. after work begins)

**Additional questions for lawyer:**
1. Should we offer a satisfaction guarantee for consulting services? (Pros: trust, Cons: subjective quality disputes)
2. What are our obligations for project-based services under consumer protection laws?
3. How do we handle disputes over subjective quality of deliverables?
4. Can we charge cancellation fees for projects mid-way? (After work begins)
5. What disclosures are required at project purchase/agreement?
6. Are there state-specific refund laws for professional services we must comply with?
7. How do we handle refunds for international customers (EU, Canada, UK, Australia)?
8. Can we require customers to delete/not use deliverables after refund? (Enforceable?)

**Competitive Benchmarking (consulting services):**
- **ISO consulting firms:** Typically no refunds after work begins, deposits non-refundable
- **Fiverr/Upwork:** Refunds if deliverables don't match description, disputes handled via platform
- **Professional services firms:** Full refund before work begins, no refunds after
- **Coaching/consulting:** Common to have "satisfaction guarantee" within 7-14 days

**Recommended Approach (Lawyer to confirm):**
- ✅ **Full refund before work begins** (clear, fair, builds trust)
- ✅ **No refunds after deliverables provided** (except major service failures)
- ✅ **Optional: 7-14 day satisfaction guarantee** (only if deliverables materially deficient)
- ✅ **Full EU withdrawal right compliance** (with "work begins immediately" consent)
- ✅ **Transparent about pro-rating** (only for work not yet performed)
