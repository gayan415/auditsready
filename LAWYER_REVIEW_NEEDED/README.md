**Good luck, and don't skip this step!**

Legal protection is not optional for a business like AuditsReady. You're giving compliance advice in a high-stakes industry ($50k-$150k ISO certifications). One lawsuit without proper protection could bankrupt the company.

**Invest the $6k-$10k now. It's cheaper than defending even a frivolous lawsuit.**
