## Follow-Up Email (Send 3 Days Later if No Response)

**Subject:** Did you get your ISO 9001 checklist? 📋

---

Hi [Customer Name],

Just checking in to make sure you received the ISO 9001 checklist I sent a few days ago!

Sometimes emails end up in spam folders, so I wanted to confirm the downloads worked for you.

**Quick questions:**

1. Did you receive the checklist PDF?
2. Have you had a chance to review it?
3. Any questions about where to start?

If you need any clarification or want to discuss your specific situation, just reply to this email or book a quick call: [Calendly link]

**Common questions I get at this stage:**

- *"Where do I even start?"* → Begin with Clause 4 (Context) and Clause 5 (Leadership) in Month 1
- *"Do I need a consultant?"* → Not necessarily - AI tools can handle 80% of what consultants do
- *"How long will this take?"* → 6 months with focused effort, or 3 months with AI assistance

Happy to help guide you through this!

Cheers,
Gayan Jayasundara
